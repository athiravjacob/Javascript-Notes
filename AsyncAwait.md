Async keyword is used to create a async function
Async function always return a promise
If you dont return a non promise value js will automatically wrap that value and retuen an object

asyn await are used to handle promises.
await can only be used inside a async function
when using async await, JS engine waits for promise to be resolved.This is the difference between using promise and async await
