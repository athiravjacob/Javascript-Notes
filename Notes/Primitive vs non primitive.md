Primitive datatype gets the fixed amount of memory at compile time.
 This technique is called as Static Memory Allocation.
 It is stored in STACK memory so it is fast and known as being immutable data types means we cannot change or increase its content after it is created.


 Non â€” primitive follows the technique of Dynamic Memory Allocation where memory allocation is not fixed and it depends on the content. It is stored in HEAP memory so it is slow compare to primitive datatype and known as being mutable data types means we can change or increase its content
