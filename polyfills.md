Polyfills are pieces of code that provide modern functionality to older browsers that lack native support for those features.
Polyfills achieve this by detecting if a feature or API is missing and then providing a custom implementation of that feature using existing JavaScript capabilities. By using polyfills, developers can write code using the latest JavaScript features and APIs without worrying about whether they are supported by all targeted browsers.

 Imagine we want to use the Array.prototype.includes() method, which determines whether an array includes a specific element. However, this method is not supported in some older browsers like Internet Explorer 11. To address this issue, we can use a polyfill for Array.prototype.includes().
// Polyfill for Array.prototype.includes(

    
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function(searchElement) {
    for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      if (this[i] === searchElement) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  };
}

)
By including this polyfill in our code, we can use Array.prototype.includes() safely, even in browsers that don't support it natively.
